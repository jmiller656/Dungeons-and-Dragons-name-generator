# Dungeons and Dragons name generator
The name is pretty self explanatory, I guess. This is a project for generating new
dungeons and dragons character names. I decided that a fun way to do this was to 
use an LSTM char-rnn and train it on data from [this site](http://www.dnd.kismetrose.com/).
Don't use keras as much as tensorflow, so writing this was made a lot easier when having
[this project](https://github.com/ekzhang/char-rnn-keras) as a reference.
